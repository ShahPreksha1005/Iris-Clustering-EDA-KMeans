# Iris Dataset Analysis and Clustering with K-Means

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the famous Iris dataset, with a focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering. The project leverages K-Means clustering to identify natural groupings within the data and includes visualizations to reveal patterns and relationships among key features.

## Project Overview

- **Univariate Analysis:** Explores the distribution of individual features such as Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width, using histograms and bar plots.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Examines relationships between pairs of variables through scatter and pair plots, and highlights variations across species using violin plots.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Uses a correlation matrix and heatmap to visualize the relationships between numerical features, uncovering strong positive correlations like that between Sepal Length and Petal Length.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Employs K-Means clustering to classify observations into groups. The Elbow Method and silhouette scores are used to determine the optimal number of clusters, which is identified as 2.
  
## Key Findings

- Strong positive correlations were observed, particularly between Sepal Length and Petal Length.
- K-Means clustering indicated two optimal clusters within the data, providing clear boundaries for analysis.

## Conclusion

This analysis of the Iris dataset not only offers insights into feature distributions and relationships but also demonstrates effective clustering methods, contributing to a deeper understanding of this classic dataset.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
